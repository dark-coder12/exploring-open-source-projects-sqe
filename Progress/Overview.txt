                                                                              Introduction
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine,
the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

                                                                              Asynchronous operations
Generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms which provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in it standard library that prevent JavaScript
code from blocking. When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting
CPU cycles waiting, it will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without
introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

                                                                              Front-end & Back-end in JavaScript
Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the
client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

                                                                              ECMAScript Version
In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you oversee 
deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

                                                                               Code Snippet
A simple code example which creates a server and ends the response with Hello World, for running this snippet we merely must type node server.js in our terminal,
where server.js is filename.

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log (`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
