React is open to contribution according to the contribution guidelines given in React Docs. All the react contribution is done on Github to maintain the code history and updates professionally.
https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html

All the changes are directly submitted to the main branch.
React don’t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases, as it prefers to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing.

You can test the changes you made through different ways like :

1. If you want to try your changes in your existing React project, you may copy following :
build/node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js, build/node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js,
cd ~/path_to_your_react_clone/
yarn build react/index,react/jsx,react-dom/index,scheduler --type=NODE

2. If your project uses React from npm, you may delete react and react-dom in its dependencies and use yarn link to point them to your local build folder. Note that instead of --type=UMD you’ll want to pass --type=NODE when building. You’ll also need to build the scheduler package:

cd build/node_modules/react
yarn link
cd build/node_modules/react-dom
yarn link

cd ~/path/to/your/project
yarn link react react-dom
