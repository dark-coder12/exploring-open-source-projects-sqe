React follows semantic versioning. 

- Patch versions are released for critical bugfixes : when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
- Minor versions for new features or non-essential changes : when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- Major versions for any breaking changes : when you make incompatible API change

For a breaking changes :
Introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

React has issued a versioning policy to in depth explain about each type of version and how it is catered.
