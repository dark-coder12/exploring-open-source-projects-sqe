16.8.0	6 February 2019
This was one of the major release of React as it introduced "Hooks" that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. This was a major attraction for all the developers.

Example : in this code 'useState' hook is used

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

2.It also added ReactTestRenderer.act() and ReactTestUtils.act() for batching updates

Example :
TestRenderer.act() prepares a component for assertions. Using it for create

let root; 
act(() => {
  root = create(<App value={1}/>)
});

// make assertions on root 
expect(root.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();

TestUtils.act() Tmakes your test run closer to how React works in the browser

  // Test first render and componentDidMount
  act(() => {
    ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);
  });

3.Improve useReducer Hook lazy initialization API.
