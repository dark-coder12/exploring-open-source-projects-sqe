 React JS uses PWA for a better experience as it is beneficial in the following ways :
 
1.Speed: PWA-powered website is faster than a normal website. Since all web pages will be cached, they take less to load when users revisit the website. 

2.Highly compatible: PWA works with almost all operating systems & browsers

3.Offline working mode: Since data is pre-cached, users can access the website content with or without internet connection. 

4.SEO friendly: PWA can help websites to achieve a high Google Core Web Vitals score, thus, increase traffic & customer retention rate.
