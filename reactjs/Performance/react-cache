React has files for cached data where the code is stores so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-cache
A basic cache for React applications. It also serves as a reference for more advanced caching implementations.
This package is meant to be used alongside yet-to-be-released, experimental React features. It's unlikely to be useful in any other context..
