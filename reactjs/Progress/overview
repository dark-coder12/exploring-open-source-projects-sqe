React language is a component-based, open-source JavaScript library for front-end development. 
It is specifically used to build user interfaces for single-page applications.

Brief History:
React was created by Jordan Walke, a Software Engineer at Facebook, out of necessity to help streamline Facebookâ€™s UI and make the app easier to manage as it grew. At first, it was just for resolving Facebook's own problem; however, once React was made open source, it had an immediate audience. Facebook being the largest social media platform in the world at that time boosted the popularity of React. The initial release came on May 29, 2013 and now it is one of the most used code library. World's leading companies including Facebook, Instagram, Uber, Paypal and Netflix use react.

Key points to focus while analysing React's code:
1. Versions till now
2. Architecture and modularity requirements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Project's security requirements
5. Reliability requirements
6. Documentation needs 

While searching each point will be further broken down according to the features of the project.
