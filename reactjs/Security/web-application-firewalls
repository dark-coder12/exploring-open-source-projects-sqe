A WAF is a software filter used in React that monitors, analyzes, and filters incoming traffic in order to discover and prevent harmful material.

There are three techniques to establish a web application firewall:

1.Hardware-level network-based firewall protection.

2.The integrated host-based firewall within the program.

3.Cloud-based WAF

WAFâ€™s signature-based filtration is highly efficient against SQL injection, XSS, execution of unauthorized code, and zip slip.

Implementing a Web Application Firewall is one of the finest React security best practices.
