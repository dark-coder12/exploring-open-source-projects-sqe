Achieving 100% error free code is still no achivable, there is always a 0.1% posiibility for an error.

to achieve fault-tolerance React uses error boundaries. Currently the API is only available in class components and it looks something like:

componentDidCatch(error) {
  // When this gets called, you know an error has occurred!
  // Hurray for fault detection!

  // We can now do things like call setState to render a fallback
  // UI so that our users know an error has occurred.
  this.setState({ error, showFallback: true });
}
