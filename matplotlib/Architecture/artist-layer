The artist layer is the middle layer, and it uses the Renderer to put ink on the canvas.

Everything in the Figure is an Artist Instance, the title, lines, tick labels, images and more.

There are two types of Artist objects. The first type is the primitive type, such as a Line2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text. And the second type is the composite type, such as the Axis, Tick, Axes and Figure.

It is important to notice that each composite artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists. For example a figure artist can contain an axis artist as well as a rectangle or text artist.

The coupling between the Artist hierarchy and the backend happens in the draw method. 

The Artist doesn't know what kind of backend the renderer is going to draw onto (PDF, SVG, GTK+ DrawingArea, etc.) but it does know the Renderer API and will call the appropriate method (draw_text or draw_path).
