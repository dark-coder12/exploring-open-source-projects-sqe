It is the top layer, designed to make Matplotlib work like a MATLAB script. It is a collection of command style functions and is therefore considered the easiest layer to use.

Scripting layer automates the process of putting everything together. Thus, it is easier to use than the Artist layer.

Scripting layer plotting is sometimes also called procedural plotting.

Matplotlibâ€™s scripting layer is essentially the matplotlib.pyplot interface, which automates the process of defining a canvas and defining a figure artist instance and connecting them.
