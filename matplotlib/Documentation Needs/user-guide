All of the components separately mentioned in documentation including tutorials, development guide, installations collectively make up the user guide. This section opens with a highly abstract index page with all that there is to know about Matplotlib. This abstract is further divided with major sections and minor subheadings related to all queries any user may have, ranging from installation, and first plots to explanations, examples, tutorials, FAQS, troubleshooting, 2D \ 3D Modelling, Licenses, Versioning and Release Notes. Thus the documentation is complete and extensive from every view point.
