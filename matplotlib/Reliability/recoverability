Recoverability refers to a software's reaction to failures, and whether it works as intended after an unexpected situation.

Matplotlib has discussed a few pointers with regards to what steps a user can take during errors in code trunking or commiting (during open source contribution) and also discussed them in it's documentation.

-> Erronous trunk rebases can be stopped by
git rebase --abort

-> Reset branch back to the saved point
git reset --hard tmp

-> Incase a backup wasn't made
git reflog show cool-feature

-> Resetting before failure
git reset --hard cool-feature@{2}

-> Correcting a wrong commit message
git branch tmp HEAD
# interactive rebase
git rebase -i 6ad92e5

this opens a text editor with the previous message, and you can then correct it.


In terms of coding within the language:

import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update(mpl.rcParamsDefault)

such a code snippet restores defaults after a wrong procedure.
