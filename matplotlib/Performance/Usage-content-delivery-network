A CDN is a group of geographically distributed and interconnected servers. They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its delivery.

This improves web performance by reducing the time needed to send content / media to the users.

Matplotlib being a library is not directly related to CDN's, however, the language it is built in, is. Python has a cdnupload command that that uploads your site’s static files to the Content Delivery Network's origin server. Matplotlib's figures can easily be uploaded through CDN.

It generates a JSON “key mapping” that maps file paths to destination keys. A destination key is a file path with a hash in it based on the file’s contents. This allows us to set up the CDN to cache our static files.

Installation:

$ pip install cdnupload

$ cdnupload /website/static s3://static-bucket --key-map=statics.json
uploading script.js to script_8f3283c6342816f7.js
uploading style.css to style_abcdef0123456789.css
writing key map JSON to statics.json

To integrate in Python: 

import json, settings

def init_server():
    with open('statics.json') as f:
        settings.statics = json.load(f)

def static_url(path):
    return '//mycdn.com/' + settings.statics[path]

If Amazon S3 is to be used as a destination, boto3 should be used.
pip install boto3

Commands to upload a specific path:

/path/to/my/python -m cdnupload
