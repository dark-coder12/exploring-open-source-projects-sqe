There are a few conditions that must be met while preparing for a new release.

-> Testing
When preparing for a release, the final tagged commit should be tested before uploading.
pytest -n 8.

-> GitHub statistics
Extract PRs, and authors from GitHub via the API. Copy the current doc/users/github_stats.rst to doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.Z.rst, changing the link target at the top of the file, and removing the "Previous GitHub Stats" section at the end.

For example, when updating from v3.2.0 to v3.2.1:
cp doc/users/github_stats.rst doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst
$EDITOR doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst
to
git add doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst

-> Re-generate the updated statistics
python tools/github_stats.py --since-tag v3.2.0 --milestone=v3.2.1 --project 'matplotlib/matplotlib' --links > doc/users/github_stats.rst

-> Update and validate the docs
Merge *-doc branch
Merge the most recent 'doc' branch into the branch you are going to tag on and then delete the doc branch.

-> Update supported versions in Security Policy
When making major or minor releases, update the supported versions in the Security Policy in SECURITY.

-> Update release notes
Only needed for major and minor releases not bugfixes.
Merge the contents of all the files in doc/users/next_whats_new/ into a single file doc/users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_X.Y.0.rst and delete the individual files.

-> API changes
Primarily needed for major and minor releases.
-> Merge the contents of all the files in doc/api/next_api_changes/ into a single file doc/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.Z.rst and delete the individual files.

-> Release notes TOC
Update doc/users/release_notes.rst:

->For major and minor releases add a new section
prev_whats_new/whats_new_X.Y.0.rst
/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.0.rst
prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.0.rst

->For bugfix releases add the GitHub stats and (if present) the API changes to the existing X.Y section./api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.Z.rst
prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.Z.rst

-> Verify that docs build
Test that the docs build cleanly.

-> Update supported versions in SECURITY.md
For minor version release update the table in SECURITY.md to specify that the 2 most recent minor releases in the current major version series are supported.
For a major version release update the table in SECURITY.md to specify that the last minor version in the previous major version series is still supported. 

-> Create release commit and tag
git tag -a -s v2.0.0
