The following PNGS are attached to show that Matplotlib has

1) Separate branches to maintain each version.
2) Pre Release Beta Testing is also offered
3) Releases overall do not follow a detailed structure on GitHub (no particular improvement from 1'st to Last Version's Upload). However, the documentation is highly professional and extensive.
4) Tags are properly given to identify separate versions.
5) Ticks example is given to show how an added feature is documented in a release.
