Matplotlib offers a separate page with efficient navigation to hold links to all previous versions and the changes made in them. The main page holds an index to all of the changes in a chronological order.

Upon clicking 3.3.0's version, changes were made clear using clear documentation and code snippets.

For instance:
1) A new feature included an extra parameter "loc" for ticks / labels of figures for simplified positioning, a highly understandable figure and code was attached.
The figure clearly shows the output when left, right or bottom are selected and how the plot changes.


2) Allow tick formatters to be set with str or function inputs
set_major_formatter and set_minor_formatter now accept str or function inputs in addition to Formatter instances.
For a str a StrMethodFormatter is automatically generated and used. 
For a function a FuncFormatter is automatically generated and used. 

ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('{x} km')
ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(lambda x, pos: str(x-5))
are shortcuts for:

import matplotlib.ticker as mticker

ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mticker.StrMethodFormatter('{x} km'))
ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(
    mticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: str(x-5))
    
It's clear from the example that {x} now replaces a long function mticker.StrMethodFormatter('{x}').

Thus the documentation is supported by figures and code to show proof of added / edited functionality.
