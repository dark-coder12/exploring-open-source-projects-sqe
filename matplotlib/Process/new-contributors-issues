Some are specifically for new ones, referred as good first issues. These are well documented issues, that do not require a much understanding of the source code. These are further tagged with difficulty levels.Easy, Medium and Hard depending on Python complexity used.

Issues can also be created for bug reporting, which should follow the guidelines:
