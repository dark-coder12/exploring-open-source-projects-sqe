Issues help in good project communication for making feature requests, reporting bugs, identifying major projects to work on, and discussing priorities. 

Members with permissions of issues can achieve the following: 

-> Update labels for issues and PRs.
-> Reproduce the issue, if the posted code is a bug label the issue with "status: confirmed bug".
-> Identify regressions, determine if the reported bug used to work as expected in a recent version of Matplotlib.
-> Close usage questions and politely recommend Stack Overflow instead and label as "community support".
-> Close duplicate issues, after confimring they are indeed duplicates.
-> Close issues that cannot be replicated, after leaving time to add extra information.


Questions / Suggestions while maintaining Issues: 

-> Thank the reporter for opening an issue
-> Is this a usage question? If so close it with a polite message.
-> Is the necessary information provided?
-> Is the issue minimal and reproducible?
-> If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification, add your simpler example.
-> Is this a regression?
-> Is this a duplicate issue?

To Join The Team:

Correctly triage 2-3 issues.
Ask someone on the triage team (publicly or privately) to recommend you to the triage team.


Incase of lack of permissions, @matplotlib/triageteam can be tagged to send in recommendations.
