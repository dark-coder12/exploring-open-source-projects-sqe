This file contains the step by step guide to get started with deploying a NodeJS application on Google Cloud.

1) Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, create an account.

2) In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.Go to project selector

3) Install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI.

To set the default project for your Cloud Run service:
    `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`
    
4) Write the sample application
    To write an application in Node.js:

    Create a new directory named helloworld and change directory into it:
            `mkdir helloworld`
            `cd helloworld`
            
5) Create a package.json file with the following contents:


      `{
        "name": "helloworld",
        "description": "Simple hello world sample in Node",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "private": true,
        "main": "index.js",
        "scripts": {
          "start": "node index.js"
        },
        "engines": {
          "node": ">=12.0.0"
        },
        "author": "Google LLC",
        "license": "Apache-2.0",
        "dependencies": {
          "express": "^4.17.1"
        }
      }`
      
6) In the same directory, create a index.js file, and copy the following lines into it:
      `run/helloworld/index.jsView on GitHub Feedback`
  
      `const express = require('express');
      const app = express();

      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        const name = process.env.NAME || 'World';
        res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
      });

      const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
      app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`helloworld: listening on port ${port}`);
      });`
      
This code creates a basic web server that listens on the port defined by the PORT environment variable.

Your app is finished and ready to be deployed.

7) Deploy to Cloud Run from source

    To deploy from source. In your source code directory, deploy from source using the following command:
        `gcloud run deploy`
        
And Now application is deployed on Google Cloud.
