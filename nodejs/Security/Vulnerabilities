Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)
Node.js provides APIs to validate handling of Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in certficates used to connect to a TLS/SSL endpoint. If certificates can be crafted which result in incorrect validation by the Node.js APIs that is considered a vulnerability.

Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (CWE-444)
Node.js provides APIs to accept http connections. Those APIs parse the headers received for a connection and pass them on to the application. Bugs in parsing those headers which can result in request smuggling are considered vulnerabilities.

Missing Cryptographic Step (CWE-325)
Node.js provides APIs to encrypt data. Bugs that would allow an attacker to get the original data without requiring the decryption key are considered vulnerabilities.

External Control of System or Configuration Setting (CWE-15)
If Node.js automatically loads a configuration file which is not documented and modification of that configuration can affect the confidentiality of data protected using the Node.js APIs this is considered a vulnerability.
