The “Story Animation Tool” system, herein referred to as “The System,”  and “The Software” will help ease out storytelling and will be available on Playstore as well as App Store. It is a story animation tool that transforms user’s narrations into real time animations. More specifically, this system is designed to allow a user to simply enter the text under strict guidelines and the system will provide a short animation video with speech bubbles and without audio. 

This system is neither part of a large system nor related to any of the other software products before, rather this tool is being developed from scratch. This system will run on laptops, LCDs, android, and apple phones. A bit of an overview of this system is that it generates a story from the text in English given by the user.

The SAT generates the animated stories for the kids, as kids by themselves cannot enter the text into the system, so they are not the intended users of this system. The actual users of the system are adults, and they will enter the text, download, and share the video. The one and only constraint on the user regarding education is the English language. The user of SAT must have good command over the English language, its tenses, grammar, and vocabulary. Any other prior experience of such a tool, technical applications is not required for the usage of this software, as SAT is not so difficult to use if the person is good at English language, he can easily use the system as the system display’s all the instructions on its screen.
