Software Quality Engineering brought immense opportunities to utilize different technologies to ensure the software we develop is actually on par with standards accepted
word wide, and with our own requirements. The project had four phases and required us to make a team of three (i.e. Izza Mujeeb, Bisma Ashar, Shehryar Munir). 

The first phase being; choosing an open-source software to extract user story requirements and then write Behavior Driven tests for. We opted for GitLab and wrote
scenario outlines for BDD using Gherkin Language, ensuring testing each control flow for the features we tested, such as Milestones, Projects, and Code Snippets. User
stories, and Test Cases were documented on Notion, while task distribution was maintained on ClickUp with proper labelling, and regular updates were posted on Slack. 

The second phase involved end-to-end testing, API testing, and documentation on our chosen project “GitHub”. End-to-end testing was done using Cucumber and Nightwatch
JS. Previous test scenarios were written in Feature files, with their implementation being in the Step Definition folder, and front-end links present in the Page Object
folder (to maintain dynamic behaviour).
